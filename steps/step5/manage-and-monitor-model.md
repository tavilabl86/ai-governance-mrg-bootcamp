### 🔹 Step 6: Monitor the Model in Production  

**Who:** Operations & Model Developer Team 

>[!Note]
> Now after **AIOps Engineer** will complete the deployment of asset in **Production Space** when get approval from **Buisness Unit Leader** he will involve Model developer in managing and monitoring **Agentic RAG Detached prompt** asset in Production.

-> AIOps Engineer - Deployer Tasks (Step 5)

-> After completing Deployer Tasks AIOps engineer continue tracking deployed asset in AI Use case along with **Model Developer** in **Governance Console** by following below steps:
