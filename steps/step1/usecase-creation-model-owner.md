## 📌 What is a  Use Case?

A **Use Case** in IBM Governance Console is used to document and govern one or more models developed to fulfill a specific business objective. It acts as a centralized record for model development, compliance, risk tracking, and approval workflows.

> ✅ **A Use Case should be created whenever there's a business requirement that needs one or more AI/ML assets (e.g., models, prompts, or agents).**

---

## 🎯 Why Create a Use Case?

Creating a Use Case helps:

* Centralize governance of related models.
* Manage risks, compliance requirements, and ownership in one place.
* Track model performance and approvals across the model lifecycle.
* Link models to Business Entities for traceability and audit readiness.

👉 Use “No” only when the risk or control clearly does not apply.
👉 If unsure, check the guidance notes or consult your risk team before leaving a field blank.
👉 Always review the final list of risks assigned after submission to confirm they reflect your business process.
