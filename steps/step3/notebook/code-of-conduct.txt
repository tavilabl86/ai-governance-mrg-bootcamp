Our Code
of Conduct
2025

Code of Conduct
Our Code of Conduct represents our shared obligation to operate with the highest
level of integrity and ethical conduct. We set high expectations and hold ourselves
accountable. We do the right thing - not necessarily what’s easy or expedient. We
strive to abide by the letter and spirit of the laws and regulations everywhere we do
business and have zero tolerance for unethical behavior. Personal accountability and
ownership are priorities at JPMorganChase.
We play an essential role in the community by bringing people together and
enabling companies and individuals to attain their goals. The Code of Conduct and
firm policies are designed to encourage exceptional business relationships, enabling
us to continually build on our proud heritage. Our purpose reminds us that the work
we do matters and has significant impact in the communities where we operate.
Therefore, we must always act with integrity and be responsible for our actions.
Respect for each other as well as those with whom we do business is not only
expected but required.
What you do and how you do it is important. We are responsible for upholding the
values that made JPMorganChase the respected company it is today. That is why it’s
crucial to share concerns when something doesn't seem right. If you encounter or
suspect illegal or unethical conduct, report it immediately.
Remember, your actions matter.

About this Document
The Code of Conduct ("Code") sets forth the expectation that employees conduct
themselves with integrity, at all times. It provides employees with the principles to
help govern their conduct with clients, customers, suppliers, vendors, shareholders,
fellow employees, regulators, markets, and the communities in which we operate.
The Code applies to the employees and directors of JPMorgan Chase & Co. ("firm" or
"JPMorganChase") and its direct and indirect subsidiaries.
The Code is designed to be consistent with the regulatory and legal
framework that governs our industry. It may be amended as required by law,
regulation or otherwise. All amendments are effective immediately upon posting.
The Code is administered by Code of Conduct Compliance. The most current
version can be accessed on our firm’s internal and external websites.
Code of Conduct Compliance can provide interpretative guidance on the principles
in the Code, in consultation with LOB Compliance, the Chief Compliance Officer or
the General Counsel, as appropriate. Any waiver of the provisions of this Code or
internal policy for a member of the JPMorganChase Operating Committee or a
director must be reported to the Office of the Secretary for Board of Directors
approval and, where applicable, disclosure to JPMorganChase stockholders.
Failure to adhere to the Code or the firm's conduct expectations may result in
disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. The Code does
not create any rights to continued employment and is not an employment contract.
In general, consultants, agents and contract or temporary workers are
expected to comply with the underlying principles of the Code as well as the
Supplier Code of Conduct.

There are several ways to report a potential or actual violation
or raise a concern. Reporting can be done anonymously,
where permitted by law. Translation services are also available.
JPMorganChase strictly prohibits intimidation or retaliation

our Code of Conduct, in good faith, or assists with an
investigation or inquiry.

1.0 Leading with Integrity

1.1 Our Ethics

1.3 Personal Integrity and Ethical Decision Making

JPMorganChase is committed to ensuring employees act with honesty
and integrity, treat customers fairly, and exercise sound judgment. This
means doing the right thing, and raising concerns, even when it is not easy
or expedient. Our commitment to ethical business practices preserves our
firm's reputation and creates a safe, healthy, productive, and collaborative
work environment.

The Code will help guide you in making ethical decisions, but you won’t
find the answer to every possible situation. In the absence of a specific
policy or procedure, you have a responsibility to use good judgment,
comply with the spirit and the intent of the Code, and seek help from your
manager or Compliance Officer.
Always deal fairly and in good faith with our customers, suppliers,
competitors, business partners, regulators, and other employees. Never
take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment,
abuse of privileged or confidential information, misrepresentation of
material fact, or any other unfair dealings or practices.

Personal accountability and ownership are priorities at our firm. We expect
you to hold yourself to the highest standards of ethical conduct. Always
conduct yourself appropriately when acting on behalf of our firm - both
inside and outside of the workplace. Your actions should reflect the firm's
culture of integrity, accountability, respect, and inclusivity.

1.2 Compliance with the Law and Firm Policies
The financial industry is highly regulated. Being aware of and complying
with the laws and regulations under which we operate is not just a critical
part of our business, but fundamental to who we are. You are expected to
know and comply with the laws, regulations, and firm policies, including
foundational risk management policies, that apply to you. It is also
important to comply with the spirit and intent of laws, regulations, and firm
policies.
Violating the law or engaging in unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts or
practices may weaken customer confidence, put our reputation at risk,
impact market integrity, or result in regulator criticism, legal action, fines
or penalties, or other negative repercussions.

Our competitive advantage comes through our superior products and
services, never through unethical or illegal business practices.
JPMorganChase is committed to complying with both the laws and
regulations that address market integrity. Be mindful of sharing
information and your interactions with competitors. Refrain from any
action that may prevent, restrict, or alter fair competition. Do not
compromise our firm's reputation or your own by engaging or appearing
to engage in any form of corruption or misconduct. Never give, offer,
promise, solicit, or accept anything of value - whether directly or indirectly
through others such as third-party intermediaries - if it is intended or
could be perceived as intended to improperly influence decisions on
behalf of our firm. Be alert and escalate activities that are designed to
hinder or prevent the detection of improper or illegal activity (e.g., money
laundering, tax evasion, bribery, etc.).
Take ownership – help manage the firm’s risk by anticipating and
identifying the impacts of the decisions you make at work. You are
responsible for your actions. No one has the authority to tell you to do
something unethical or illegal.

Always follow the Code. If your business unit adopts policies that are more
specific than the Code, you must follow those policies. In the event of a
conflict with any provision of the Code and local law, you should always
follow the law.

1.4 Sharing Concerns
Use your voice and escalate your concerns, regardless of whether it directly
affects you or your department. Promptly report any potential or actual
violations of the Code, firm policy, or law or regulation related to our
business. You are encouraged to ask questions and have open conversations
with your manager on business and conduct issues. We rely on you to speak
up when something is unclear.

You must do the right thing when it comes to your own conduct, and you
must speak up about conduct by others that might violate our Code or
firm policies. This includes promptly reporting conduct concerns and
cooperating as directed by our firm with any investigation or inquiry.
We all have a responsibility to understand and uphold the principles of the
Code. Compliance with the Code is a condition of employment. Action may
be taken against employees who violate the Code or who fail to report the
violations of others, up to and including termination of employment.

If you witness or suspect that something is illegal or unethical, you have the
right and an obligation to share your concerns. You must immediately report
to Human Resources certain charges or arrests that involve you personally,
whether they relate to the business of our firm or not.

1.3.1 Manager Responsibilities

There are several ways to report your concerns. You can raise issues with
your manager, your Compliance Officer, Global Security or Human
Resources. You can also call the JPMorganChase Conduct Hotline toll-free at
1-855-JPMCODE (1-855-576-2633). The Hotline is operated by an
independent third-party service and is available any time - night or day. You
can also file a report online. Where permitted by applicable law, you may
report anonymously. For more information on who to contact, refer to the
Report a Potential Violation or Concern page.

Managers have an even greater level of responsibility. They must set the
example, lead with integrity, and reinforce the firm's ethical culture
through their words and actions. Managers are often the first resource for
employees who have questions on ethical issues or firm policy. If unsure of
the best course of action, managers are responsible for directing their
employees to the correct resource. They may be held responsible for their
failure to report misconduct, escalate appropriately, or take steps to
address or remediate an issue. Managers must create an environment
where others feel comfortable sharing concerns and ensure their
employees are protected from retaliation for reporting such concerns.

You are required to report violations whether they involve you or someone
else, including other employees, consultants, contract or temporary workers,
business partners or agents, or our customers or suppliers. Do not
investigate potential violations yourself. Report it and the matter will be
investigated by the appropriate parties. You must cooperate as directed by
our firm in any investigation or inquiry.

Principles in Practice
I am covering a new client and notice a customer transaction that seems odd. I
don’t know if I should escalate. What should I do?

Just as you will be held responsible for your own actions, you can also be held
responsible for not reporting actions you knew or should have known were in
violation of any applicable policy, law, or regulation. Reporting to our firm
does not prevent you from reporting conduct that you believe to be an actual
or potential violation of law to the government or regulators.

You should escalate to your manager and, if necessary, contact your Compliance
Officer for assistance. Every employee is responsible for escalating unusual or
potentially suspicious transactions or activities. Doing so will protect you and our
firm from involvement in questionable or illegal activities.

1.4.1 Our Commitment to Non-Retaliation
Don't be afraid to speak up. JPMorganChase policies and restrictions on
disclosing confidential information do not prevent you from reporting
concerns to the government, a regulator, your attorney, or a court under seal.
Our firm strictly prohibits intimidation or retaliation against anyone who
makes a good faith report about a potential or actual violation of the Code,
firm policy, or any law or regulation governing our business. We also strictly
prohibit intimidation or retaliation against anyone who assists with an inquiry
or investigation of any such violation.
Be assured that the information you provide will be handled discreetly and
only shared with those we must inform, such as regulators and those involved
in investigating, resolving, and remediating the issue. Employees who have
concerns about or are aware of possible retaliatory action must report it,
either to their manager, Human Resources, or the JPMorganChase Conduct
Hotline.

Principles in Practice
I overheard a colleague discussing something that I think may violate the Code of
Conduct. I'm not sure I should report it since it doesn't directly affect me.
Not complying with the Code can cause immeasurable damage to our reputation
and put you, your co-workers, our customers, and our firm at risk. It can also lead
to regulatory and legal consequences. Where permitted by law, you may report
concerns anonymously for additional peace of mind. Not reporting concerns is
also a violation of the Code and could lead to disciplinary consequences. Your
voice helps promote our ethical culture. Use it!

2.0 Avoiding Conflicts of Interest

2.1 Avoiding Conflicts of Interest

2.2 Outside Interests and Other External Activities

Your personal interests should never conflict — or appear to conflict— with
our firm's interests. Avoid activities or relationships that might affect your
objectivity in making decisions on behalf of our firm or undermine your
credibility. Conflicts may damage the firm's reputation, cause loss of business,
and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny or litigation risk.

Your Outside Interests and other external activities cannot restrict the firm's
business opportunities, reflect adversely on our firm (e.g., create exposure to
regulatory, reputational, or financial risk), or create a perceived or actual
conflict of interest with our firm, clients, or suppliers, or cause a disruption to
our operations. You are expected to put your job at our firm ahead of
personal business opportunities (including secondary employment) and
government service.

Our firm often has fiduciary obligations to our clients to act in their best
interest, by which you should abide. Always escalate perceived and actual
conflicts of interest so that the proper review is completed, and the required
steps are taken to help mitigate identified conflicts. Never place personal
interests ahead of our clients.
Some conflicts may be obvious while others are more subtle, but both can
have lasting effects. Potential conflicts may arise in a variety of ways, including
through: (1) Outside Interests and other external activities; (2) personal
relationships; (3) the exchange of gifts and business hospitality; (4) political
engagement; and (5) personal finances.
It's not possible to list every situation that could present a potential conflict, but
you should be familiar with the risks associated with the activities listed above.
Use good judgment and ask for help whenever you are unsure of the proper
course of action. Appropriately addressing conflicts helps protect the firm by
preventing the misuse of confidential information and firm assets.
Personal accountability and ownership are priorities at JPMorganChase.
Always anticipate the impact of your decisions. Your actions may lead to unfair
client or customer outcomes, impact market integrity, compromise our firm's
reputation or negatively affect our firm's culture. Our policies are designed to
build honest business relationships and promote fairness in the marketplace.
Use firm resources to help guide your decisions.

Whether big or small, all conflicts need to be addressed.

We encourage you to become involved in your community and with
charitable organizations that support your personal philanthropic goals. Be
sure to follow the firm's policies governing personal activity to ensure that
your charitable work and the firm's interests are not in conflict. Soliciting
customers, suppliers, and fellow employees or using firm assets in
connection with your Outside Interests is generally prohibited.
Firm policies outline which activities are prohibited, which require
preclearance, and specify your responsibilities and the conditions you must
follow when participating in Outside Interests and other external activities.

2.3 Personal Relationships
It is always important to remain objective in your business dealings.
Personal relationships with someone you know inside or outside of work
can create a conflict of interest or raise the appearance of a conflict.
Personal conflicts of interest may occur when your interests (or the interest
of someone you know personally) conflict with the interests of
JPMorganChase or one of its clients.
Do not engage in self-dealing or act for the firm in any transaction or
business relationship that involves yourself, members of your family, or
other people or organizations where you or your family have a significant
personal connection or financial interest.

2.4 Gifts and Business Hospitality

2.6 Personal Finances

While the exchange of gifts and business hospitality may be a common
business practice, such activity can be misinterpreted or suggest the
appearance of something improper, even when there is no improper intent.
Avoid accepting or providing gifts and business hospitality to customers,
suppliers, and business partners of the firm if it creates a perceived or actual
conflict of interest or violates laws, regulations, or our firm's policies.
Employees should never solicit, suggest, or request gifts or business
hospitality in exchange for firm business or an unfair advantage.

You must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and firm policies
when managing your personal finances and investment activities. Our firm
expects you to handle your personal finances responsibly and with
integrity, and to base your personal investment decisions with long-term
objectives in mind. You may not improperly use information you learned
from work for your personal benefit. Investing in the business of a client or
supplier with whom you have — or recently had — dealings with, in your
role at the firm, can raise significant conflicts.
In addition, the improper handling of your personal finances could
undermine your credibility and the firm's or lead to increased regulatory
scrutiny. Engaging in financial transactions (e.g., borrowing, or other
lending activities, joint investments, gambling or betting – whether money
is exchanged or not, etc.) with fellow employees, customers, suppliers is
prohibited for these reasons.

2.5 Political Engagement
We respect your right to engage in personal political activity. Your political
activities are personal endeavors, but you must be mindful of potential
impact to the firm's reputation. Your contributions and activities must be
lawful, consistent with firm policies, and may not disrupt the firm or involve
the use of firm time or resources (e.g., staff, facilities, equipment, email,
phones, supplies, contacts, or corporate logos or brand names).

You must never use privileged or confidential information for personal gain
or tell, “tip”, or share information you learned through work with others.
Insider trading is illegal and strictly prohibited by firm policies. Always use
care when working away from the office and ensure your workspace
provides proper privacy.

You may not invite government officials or political figures to speak at or
attend firm events unless you comply with our firm's policy requirements.
Do not promise or imply firm sponsorship, contributions, or other support.
You may not use firm funds to contribute to or make expenditures or
election-related communications on behalf of candidates, political party
committees or political action committees.

3.0 Managing Information

3.1 Managing Information
As an employee of a publicly traded company, you may have access to
confidential or material, non-public information about our firm, clients and other
companies that conduct or seek to do business with us. You must protect this
information from unauthorized use, including from other employees who do not
have a legitimate and continuous business need to access the information.
Customers, suppliers, employees, and others who do business with our firm
trust us to be good stewards of their financial, personal, and business
information. No matter the format, protect information you manage on behalf of
the firm from theft, loss, or unauthorized access or disclosure. Do not discuss,
access, or use confidential and/or proprietary information unless you have a
legitimate business need to do so. Do not use personal devices or applications
that are not approved by the firm (e.g., Otter, Rocketbook, Code Beautification,
or personal email domains) to manage or send information related to the firm’s
business.

Your responsibility to protect confidential information also applies to work you
may have done before coming to JPMorganChase. Sharing confidential
information from a former employer is unethical and can expose you and
JPMorganChase to legal liabilities.
JPMorganChase policies and restrictions on disclosing confidential information
do not prevent employees from reporting concerns of any potential or actual
violation to our firm's management or directors, the government, a regulator,
employees' attorneys, or a court under seal. They also do not prevent
employees from reporting retaliation for reporting such concerns or
responding truthfully to questions or requests from the government, a
regulator, or in a court of law.

Your duty to protect confidential information includes taking precautions
before sharing it with anyone. Confidential information should never be
disclosed to anyone inside or outside our firm except as permitted by law, in the
proper conduct of our business, where disclosure is required by legal process,
or where the Compliance or the Legal Department otherwise determines it is
appropriate. The loss or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information
may harm our firm and its clients and may result in termination of employment.
Working remotely is considered an extension of the workplace. Uphold the
firm's standards for securing our confidential information. Exercise the same
degree of care in protecting confidential information away from the office as
you do when working in the office. Only use approved communication channels
to conduct JPMorganChase business.

3.2 Communicating Responsibly

3.3 Maintaining Data

JPMorganChase is committed to making sure communications about our
firm and its business are accurate and made by employees who are
authorized to speak on our behalf. We also recognize our obligation to
protect the confidentiality of our business and customer information.
Maintaining the confidentiality of meetings and internal communications,
such as emails, recordings, and articles, is crucial to protecting our
organization's integrity, competitive advantage, and trust. Do not engage
in unauthorized sharing of these materials, which can compromise
sensitive information, disrupt operations, and damage our reputation.

Creating and maintaining accurate and complete data is essential for
our ability to meet our business needs as well as legal and regulatory
requirements. Make sure any disclosure we make to the government,
regulatory authorities and investors meet these standards. Never falsify data.
You are responsible for maintaining the integrity of firm data, and complying
with all recordkeeping policies, controls, and procedures we have in place.

Principles in Practice

Be alert to situations where you may be perceived as representing or
speaking on behalf of JPMorganChase. Making recommendations or
referring people or companies that do or have done business with our
firm may be considered a firm endorsement, which is not allowed. Know
the limits on your authority to speak, sign, or otherwise act on behalf of
our firm, and don't take any action that exceeds those limits. Remember
to seek preclearance before speaking about the firm's business or your
role and responsibilities at the firm, in any public forum or publication.

I'm using an internal large language model to create content for a client meeting.
Some of the output does not seem balanced. Can I use the output?
Review the output to ensure it is correct prior to using it. You are responsible for the
accuracy of information you create and share on behalf of the firm - whether the
information is used internally, externally, or developed using emerging technology.

The firm respects your right to engage in social, professional, and political
dialogue outside of work. You must use good judgment when making
personal statements in public, including on your personal social media
accounts. Also use care in internal communications and be responsible
with your comments on intranet postings.
Nothing in the Code should be interpreted to prevent employees from
engaging in activities that are protected under laws and regulations that
allow employees to discuss or disclose their personal compensation
information.

3.4 Using Firm Assets
Our assets are the resources we use to conduct firm business. Use firm
assets for legitimate firm business and appropriately safeguard them
against cyber-related risk and attack, theft, loss, waste, or abuse. By
protecting our assets, we protect our competitive advantage in the
marketplace. You also have a responsibility to extend the same degree of
care to assets entrusted to our firm by others. It is essential that you
respect and protect the firm’s physical and intellectual property, as well as
our customer's information.
JPMorganChase assets may not be used for personal gain. Some firm
assets, like corporate credit cards and contact information, must never be
used for personal purposes.
Your personal use of the firm’s technology assets (e.g., phones) should be
kept to a minimum. Use of the firm’s technology assets should never
interfere with your business obligations, burden firm assets, introduce
additional risk to our firm, negatively impact colleagues or customers, or
disrupt business operations.

4.0 Our Winning Culture

4.1 A Dynamic and Thriving Workplace

4.2 Diversity and Inclusion is a Priority

Nothing is more vital to the long-term growth of JPMorganChase than
our ability to attract and retain talented and dedicated employees. You
are our most valuable asset. Always treat each other, and our customers
and suppliers, respectfully and fairly. Stay true to the values embedded in
our culture: service, heart, curiosity, courage, and excellence.

We recognize that our people are our strength, and the diverse talents and
perspectives our employees bring to our global workforce are directly
linked to our success. We seek to attract and retain the best talent and are
dedicated to providing equal employment opportunity across all
backgrounds. We strive to build and foster an inclusive work environment
where our employees are respected, trusted, and empowered. We believe
that if our teams are more diverse, we will generate better ideas and
outcomes, enjoy a stronger corporate culture, and strengthen our
competitive advantage.

We are committed to a working environment free of threats, intimidation,
physical harm, and disruption. A non-violent, safe, and healthy workplace
is critical to our well-being. We rely on you to promptly report any acts or
threats of violence, or situations that could pose a threat to others. You
are expected to comply with applicable laws and firm policies as they
relate to the health, safety and security of our workforce, our customers,
and others who may be present on our premises.

We prohibit discrimination, harassment, bias and prejudice in our
workplace and against our workforce based on an individual’s race, color,
national origin or ancestry, ethnic origin, citizenship status, creed, religion,
religious affiliation, religious views, age, sex, gender, pregnancy, maternity,
paternity, caring responsibilities, marital status, relationship status, civil
partnership, sexual orientation, transgender status, gender identity,
gender expression, intersex status, genetic information, physical or mental
disability or protected condition, military or veteran status, an individual
having been a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or abuse, an
individual being the victim of a crime, any other community group
protected under applicable law, or any other status protected under
applicable local law.

Always conduct yourself appropriately when acting on behalf of our firm
— both inside and outside of the office. Your conduct matters and can be
perceived as a reflection of our firm's standards.

We do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, or inappropriate or abusive
conduct by or against employees, customers, suppliers, contractors, or
any other individuals who conduct business or seek to do business with
our firm based on race, color, ethnicity, religion, religious affiliation,
religious views, national origin or ancestry, gender, military status,
disability, marital or familial status, political opinions, speech, or affiliations,
age, or any status protected under applicable local law.
We take all allegations of discrimination or harassment seriously. It is each
employee's responsibility to report any concern or conduct that is or may
be unlawful, abusive, or otherwise violates firm policies.

Our core values are at the heart of what we do. Managers set the “tone from the

The people, products and services, and dedication to integrity have made
JPMorganChase one of the largest and most successful financial institutions in
the world. Just as we are a leader in the financial industry, we want to be known

those you suspect. JPMorganChase doesn’t tolerate retaliation against anyone
who raises an issue or concern in good faith.
If you have questions about the Code of Conduct or any firm policy, ask your
manager, Human Resources, or local Compliance Officer for guidance.
Our continued success is based on your commitment to do the right thing.
