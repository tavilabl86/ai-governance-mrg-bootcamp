# 🧑‍🔬 Model Validator – AI Detached RAG sPrompt Performance & Quality Validation

> ⚠️ **Note:** Log in with the **Model Validator** role before accessing validation tools.

---

## 🔑 Accessing Detached RAG Prompt Validation Tools

1. Log in to IBM Cloud.
2. From the **Hamburger Menu (☰)**, navigate to **Instances**.
3. Select **openscale-defaultinstance**.
4. In the IBM Watson OpenScale dashboard, click **Open** (top right corner).

## 🎯 Validation Responsibilities

As a Model Validator, your primary role is to ensure **detached RAG prompts** meet performance, fairness, and quality standards, focusing on:

* **Fairness**
  Monitor and validate fairness metrics to detect bias against sensitive groups.

* **Alerts and Violations**
  Review alerts triggered by the system to investigate potential issues.

* **Quality Metrics**
  Assess overall **detached RAG prompt quality**, including precision, recall, and other key indicators.

* **Drift Detection**
  Track data, output, and prediction drift to ensure **detached RAG prompt stability** over time.

* **Global Explanation**
  Understand feature importance to validate **detached RAG prompt decision rationale**.

* **detached RAG prompt Performance Evaluation**
  Upload test datasets to evaluate **prompt outputs** against ground truth.

## 🔍 Validation Areas

### Fairness Validation

* Evaluate alerts related to fairness metrics (e.g., Disparate Impact, Statistical Parity Difference).
* Check alerts for sensitive groups (e.g., gender-based fairness).
* Investigate any violations flagged.

### Quality and Alerts

* Review alerts on quality metrics such as Precision, Recall, Accuracy, F1-Measure.
* Identify and address violations affecting **detached RAG prompt performance**.

### Drift Monitoring

* Observe drift alerts indicating changes in input data or **detached RAG prompt outputs**.
* Take action if drift impacts reliability.

### Generative AI Quality – Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

* Assess alerts on answer quality and retrieval accuracy.
* Monitor content analysis metrics and data safety concerns.
* Investigate alerts indicating quality or safety issues in generated responses.
