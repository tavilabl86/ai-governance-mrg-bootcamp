### 0️⃣ When and Who Creates an Issue
- **Who:**  
  - For seamless monitoring of AI assets, issues can be **created automatically** and assigned to the correct stakeholder when a model metric is in breach.
  - They can also be create by a **Use Case Owner**, **Risk Owner**, or other authorized personnel with access to the Use Case or model asset.  
  - In some organizations, issues may also be created by **auditors** or **compliance officers** if they identify a risk.
- **When:**  
  - When a **risk, incident, or non-compliance event** is identified related to a Use Case or model.  
  - Examples include:  
    - Model performance deviation  
    - Regulatory compliance breach  
    - Data quality or integrity issues  
  - The issue is logged to **track mitigation steps and notify stakeholders**.


In this lab, we will focus on a Model performance deviation issue.
